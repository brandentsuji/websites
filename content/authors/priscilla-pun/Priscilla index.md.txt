I am an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering at University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. My research interests are in the domain of internet security.  I am currently doing a project with Dr. Zheng about wideband spectrum sensing and physical Layer Security with Rotating Antenna. I am also interested in renewable energy and power systems.
