I am currently an undergradute student on my third year of a four year progam in Electrical Engineering. I am interested in working with biomedical components to aid with creating a self learning AI to adapt to a person's specific needs, and to provide the person more control over their device/limb. I hope to graduate in spring 2020, and plan to continue onto a Masters Degree in Electrical Engineering with focuses on biomedical implmentations.
