I am a doctoral student at the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. I have recently pivoted from research in graphene, liquid metal and quantum dot electronic devices to a research topic that will combine the realms of wireless security, artificial intelligence techniques and unmanned system networks.
