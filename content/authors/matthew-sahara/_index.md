I am pursuing a B.S. in Electrical Engineering in the Electro-Physics track, and I expect to graduate in Fall 2020. I have project experience related to RF hardware circuits/systems and IP-based wireless networks. I seek to provide high-quality solutions that connect and empower others—anything from powering communities to wireless communications.
