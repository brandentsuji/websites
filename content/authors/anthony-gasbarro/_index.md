I am a Master's of Electrical Engineering Student at University of Hawaiʻi Manoa, currently working with two physics PhD students on creating a commercially distributable package for running simulations of Quantum Gas Lattice Algorithms on high performance GPUs. My main interest areas are quantum computing and cybersecurity. My Bachelor's Degree is in Nuclear Engineering technology and I was formerly a Navy Nuclear Reactor operator aboard a submarine for 6 years.
