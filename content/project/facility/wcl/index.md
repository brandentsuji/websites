# Resource

- Instruments
  - *Spectrum Analyzers (Keysight N9010B, N9918A)*: WCL is equipped with two
    spectrum analzyers. The benchtop model (Keysight N9010B) operates from 10Hz
    to 7GHz and has been upgraded with a pre-amplifier and 40MHz analysis
    bandwidth. The handheld model (Keysight N9918A) operates from 30kHz to
    26.5GHz and has been upgraded with vector network analysis functions.
  - Signal Generators (Keysight 33210A):
  - Oscilloscopes (Keysight DSOX1102G):
  - Power Supplies (Keysight E36313A):
  - Multimeter ():

- RF Hardware
  - *mmWave Comm/Sensing/Sounder*: Our mmWave developing system is a customized 24-31GHz radio system implemented with a mmWave beamforming kit (BBox Lites/UD Box from TMYTEK), Ettus USRPs (N210, CDA-2990), and COTS Wi-Fi NICs (Intel 5300). The system consists of a 16-channel 24-31GHz phased array antenna and a frequency Up/Down converter, which interfaces with baseband devices (LabVIEW controlled USRPs or COTS Wi-Fi NICs). Each channel provides $ 360^{\circ} $ phase shifter coverage with $ 5^{\circ} $ per step, 400 ms beam switching time. The 3dB beam aperture is $ 13^{\circ} $ horizontally and $ 14^{\circ} $ vertically. The angle coverage is +/-$ 45^{\circ} $ horizontally and +/-$ 60^{\circ} $ vertically. The baseband devices can support up to 80MHz bandwidth with 64 subcarriers for data transmission or CSI measurements.

- RF Software
  - *Ansys HFSS*: HFSS is a commercial finite element method solver for electromagnetic structures from Ansys. The acronym stands for high-frequency structure simulator. HFSS is one of several commercial tools used for antenna design, and the design of complex radio frequency electronic circuit elements including filters, transmission lines, and packaging.
