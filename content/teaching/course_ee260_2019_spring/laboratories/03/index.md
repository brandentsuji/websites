## Github Classroom
Accept your laboratory assignment [here](TBD).

## Introduction
Boolean expressions are used to output a Boolean function of number of variables. Dataflow construct
like assign can be used to model such functions. There are circuits which have multiple outputs and
multiple inputs. In this lab you will design encoders, decoders, and read only memories. Please refer to
the Vivado tutorial on how to use the Vivado tool for creating projects and verifying digital circuits.
The Basys3 board has the following features:

## Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Design multi-output decoder circuits using behavioral modeling

- Design encoders using behavioral modeling

- Use read only memories using reg data type and $readmemb system task available in Verilog
