## Introduction
Sequential circuits are the digital circuits in which the output depends not only on the present input (like
combinatorial circuits), but also on the past sequence of inputs. In effect, these circuits must be able to
remember something about the past history of the inputs. Thus the timing concept is introduced and the
clock signal provides the timing essence to the sequential circuits. Latches and flip-flops are commonly
used memory devices in sequential circuits.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Model various types of latches

- Model flip-flops with control signals
