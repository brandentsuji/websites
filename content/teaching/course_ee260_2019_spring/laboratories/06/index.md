## Github Classroom
Accept your laboratory assignment [here](TBD).

## Introduction
When several flip-flops are grouped together, with a common clock, to hold related information the resulting
circuit is called a register. Just like flip-flops, registers may also have other control signals. You will
understand the behavior of a register with additional control signals. Counters are widely used sequential
circuits. In this lab you will model several ways of modeling registers and counters. Please refer to the
Vivado tutorial on how to use the Vivado tool for creating projects and verifying digital circuits.

## Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:
- Model various types of registers

- Model various types of counters
