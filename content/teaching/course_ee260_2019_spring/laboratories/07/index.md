## Introduction
Behavioral modeling was introduced in Lab 1 as one of three widely used modeling styles. Additional
capabilities with respect to testbenches were further introduced in Lab 4. However, there more constructs
available in this modeling style which are particularly useful for complex sequential digital circuits design.
Sequential circuits require clocking, and with clocking there is always a frequency or speed involved at
which the circuit can be run. The expected speed can be communicated to the tools through specific
timing constraints via the XDC file. In this lab you will learn more language constructs and timing
constraints concepts. Please refer to the Vivado tutorial on how to use the Vivado tool for creating
projects and verifying digital circuits.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Use various language constructs using behavioral modeling

- Communicate timing expectations through timing constraints
