## Github Classroom
Accept your laboratory assignment [here](TBD).

## Introduction
Verilog HDL modeling language allows numbers being represented in several radix systems. The
underlying circuit processes the number in binary, however, input into and output from such circuits is
typically done using decimal numbers. In this lab you will learn various representations and methods for
converting numbers from one representation into another. Please refer to the Vivado tutorial on how to
use the Vivado tool for creating projects and verifying digital circuits.

## Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Define a number in various radix

- Design combinatorial circuits capable of converting data represented in one radix into another

- Design combinatorial circuits to perform simple addition operation

- Learn a technique to improver addition speed
