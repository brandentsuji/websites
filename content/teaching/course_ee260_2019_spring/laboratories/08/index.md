## Github Classroom
Accept your laboratory assignment [here](TBD).

## Introduction
Today’s Xilinx FPGAs contain many more resources than basic LUT, CLB, IOB, and routing. The FPGAs
are now being used to implement much more complex digital circuits compared to glue logic when they
were invented. Some complex architectural resources, such as clocking, must be configured and
instantiated instead of inferred. There are also commonly used complex circuits, such as the ReedSolomon
decoder are provided by tools so that a designer does not have to “reinvent the wheel.” This lab
introduces the Architectural Wizard and the IP generator tools available through the IP Catalog. Please
refer to the Vivado tutorial on how to use the Vivado tool for creating projects and verifying digital circuits.

## Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:
- Use the Architectural Wizard to configure clocking resource

- Use the IP Catalog tool to configure and use counters and memories
