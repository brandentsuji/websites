This tutorial provides the information to install Xilinx Vivado HL Webpack edition. Xilinx Vivado Design Suite is a software suite produced by Xilinx for synthesis and analysis of HDL designs, superseding Xilinx ISE with additional features for a system on a chip development and high-level synthesis. It enables developers to synthesize (compile) their designs, perform timing analysis, examine RTL diagrams, simulate a design's reaction to different stimuli, and configure the target device with the programmer. Vivado is a design environment for FPGA products from Xilinx, and is tightly coupled to the architecture of such chips, and cannot be used with FPGA products from other vendors.

The [Vivado Design Suite HL WebPACK Edition](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado/vivado-webpack.html) is the FREE version of the design suite. Vivado HL WebPACK delivers instant access to some basic Vivado features and functionality at no cost. For the lab assignment, you will need the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite HL Webpack â€“ logic design edition with SDK. You can select SDK during the Webpack customization installation options.

Currently, Xilinx Vivado supports two platforms: Windows and Linux. If you use a Windows or a Linux computer, you can install the software directly using the respective installer (A registered account is required in order to download the installer). If you use a Mac computer, you will need a virtual environment with Windows or Linux OS to use the software. There are various software to create a virtual desktop environment, including:

  - [Amazon Workspaces](https://aws.amazon.com/workspaces/)
  - [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

The first option is recommended if your computer has limited memory (less than 4 GB) or processing power. You can create an Amazon AWS account and launch a default Windows or Linux instance in their workspace console. For detailed information, refer to the [Amazon Workspace Tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/launch-workspace-simple-ad.html). Once you have the virtual environment setup, you can access its desktop environment through the [Amazon AWS Workspace](https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/) and install Vivado using the installer.
