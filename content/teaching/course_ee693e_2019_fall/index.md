This course focuses on selected research topics of current interest in wireless security and is intended for Undergraduate, Master, or Doctoral students who are interested in doing security research or pursuing a career related to wireless security. At the end of this course, students will have a in-depth knowledge of the state-of-the-art and open problems in wireless security, thus enhancing their potential to do research or pursue a career in this rapidly developing area. This course is structured as a research seminar and laboratory where research papers from leading conferences & journals will be presented by the instructor and implemented by students. Main topics of interests include:

*Wireless Physical Layer Security*: physical layer security techniques promise information theoretic security for wireless communication. i.e., these techniques are designed to be provably secure against eavesdroppers. This segment discusses the theory and practice of physical layer security. The underlying theory is introduced and the application of these fundamentals towards practical solutions is discussed. Attacks against (practical) physical layer security techniques are presented. Theoretical and practical exercises as well as the presentation of selected recent research results by seminar talks of students further deepen the understanding of the subject matter

*Wireless Spectrum Security*: spectrum scarcity has emerged as a primary problem encountered when trying to launch new wireless services. The effects of this scarcity is most noticeable in the spectrum auctions where the operators often need to invest billions of dollars to secure access to specified bands in the available spectrum. This segment discusses the theory and method to enforce secure spectrum access and detection of unauthorized use of wireless spectrum.
